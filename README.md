</ul>
<h2>Things to Improve</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make smoother on mobile</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Thougghts</h2>
<p>Getting the game logic right was the hardest part of this project. It took a lot of googling/thinking to figure out how to set up scores, make player's Xs and Os show up on the board, and how to determine a winner. I wanted to make it a little more fun-looking, so I added a cheering crowd audio effect and a random victory gif every time someone wins. I had learned about APIs before and had used the random gif API, so I thought it would be a nice touch to add it to this project. Eventually, I'd like it to look a bit smoother on mobile. But as is, it works and I really like how the victory cheer and gif turned out.</p>
